Blog 12: Model Evaluation Metrics
Why Model Evaluation is Important?
Evaluating AI models ensures they perform well and generalize to unseen data. Different tasks require different metrics:
Classification Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
Regression Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared.
Clustering Metrics: Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index.
Techniques for Model Evaluation
1.Confusion Matrix: Evaluates classification models.
2.Cross-Validation: Splitting data for robust evaluation.
3.ROC & AUC: Measuring classification performance.
Simple Example: Classification Report
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load dataset
iris = load_iris()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.2)

# Train model
clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))
Conclusion
Model evaluation is crucial for improving AI model performance. Choosing the right metric ensures models are reliable and effective.
