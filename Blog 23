Blog 23: Transfer Learning
What is Transfer Learning?
Transfer Learning involves leveraging pre-trained models for new tasks. This reduces training time and improves accuracy. Common use cases include:
Image Classification (Using ResNet, VGG, etc.)
NLP Applications (Using BERT, GPT, etc.)
Medical Diagnosis (Using pre-trained models on medical images)
Simple Example: Using a Pre-Trained Model in Keras
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Load pre-trained model
base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Freeze layers
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False

print("Base Model Summary:")
base_model.summary()
Conclusion
Transfer learning accelerates model training and improves performance on tasks with limited data.
