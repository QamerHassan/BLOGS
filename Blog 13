Blog 13: Hyperparameter Tuning
What is Hyperparameter Tuning?
Hyperparameter tuning involves selecting the best model parameters to optimize performance. Unlike model parameters, hyperparameters are set before training. Common techniques include:
Grid Search: Exhaustive search over predefined hyperparameter values.
Random Search: Randomly selects combinations of hyperparameters.
Bayesian Optimization: Uses probabilistic models to optimize parameters efficiently.
Techniques for Hyperparameter Tuning
1.Cross-validation: Splitting data for better evaluation.
2.Automated Tuning: Using libraries like Optuna and Hyperopt.
3.Early Stopping: Preventing overfitting by stopping training early.
Simple Example: Grid Search in Scikit-Learn
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Sample dataset
X = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]]
y = [0, 1, 0, 1]

# Define model and parameters
clf = RandomForestClassifier()
param_grid = {'n_estimators': [10, 50, 100], 'max_depth': [None, 5, 10]}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(clf, param_grid, cv=3)
grid_search.fit(X, y)
print("Best parameters:", grid_search.best_params_)
Conclusion
Hyperparameter tuning is essential for maximizing model performance. Automated methods help find the best configurations efficiently.
