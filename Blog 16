Blog 16: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
What are CNNs?
CNNs are specialized deep learning architectures designed for image processing. They use:
Convolutional Layers: Extract features from images.
Pooling Layers: Reduce dimensionality.
Fully Connected Layers: Make final predictions.
Applications of CNNs
1.Image Classification: Recognizing objects in images.
2.Object Detection: Identifying objects and their locations.
3.Medical Imaging: Diagnosing diseases from scans.
Simple Example: CNN with Keras
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Define CNN model
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
print("Model summary:")
model.summary()
Conclusion
CNNs are the backbone of computer vision tasks. Understanding how they process images is crucial for AI applications in healthcare, security, and automation.
