Blog 10: Dimensionality Reduction
Why Reduce Dimensions?
High-dimensional data can lead to computational inefficiencies and overfitting. Dimensionality reduction techniques help in:
Improving Model Performance: Reducing noise.
Visualizing Data: Lower dimensions allow for better plotting.
Faster Computation: Reducing features makes training more efficient.
Techniques for Dimensionality Reduction
1.Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Projects data into lower dimensions.
2.t-SNE: Used for visualization of high-dimensional data.
3.Autoencoders: Neural networks that learn compressed representations.
Simple Example: PCA Implementation
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import numpy as np

# Sample data
X = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Apply PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_reduced = pca.fit_transform(X)

print("Reduced Data:\n", X_reduced)
Conclusion
Dimensionality reduction helps in handling high-dimensional data efficiently. Choosing the right method depends on the data distribution and use case.
