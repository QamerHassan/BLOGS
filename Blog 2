Blog 2: Mathematics for AI
Importance of Mathematics in AI
Mathematics is the foundation of AI, enabling models to learn and make decisions. Key areas include:
Linear Algebra: Essential for handling vectors, matrices, and tensors.
Probability & Statistics: Used in probabilistic models, decision making.
Calculus: Optimization techniques, gradient descent.
Discrete Mathematics: Logic, graphs, and combinatorics.
Key Concepts
1.Vectors & Matrices: Data is often represented as matrices. Operations like addition, multiplication, and dot products are fundamental.
2.Probability: Helps in Bayesian models, uncertainty estimation.
3.Derivatives & Gradients: Used for optimizing models, backpropagation.
Simple Example: Gradient Calculation
import numpy as np

def f(x):
    return x**2 + 3*x + 5

def derivative(x):
    return 2*x + 3

x = np.linspace(-10, 10, 100)
grad = derivative(x)

print("Gradient at x=2:", derivative(2))
Conclusion
A strong grasp of mathematics ensures a better understanding of how AI models work under the hood.
