Blog 19: Transformers & Attention Mechanisms
What are Transformers?
Transformers are deep learning architectures designed for NLP tasks, outperforming traditional RNNs. They rely on:
Self-Attention: Focuses on important words in a sentence.
Positional Encoding: Retains order of words in sequences.
Popular Transformer Models
1.BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
2.GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
3.T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer)
Simple Example: Using Hugging Face's Transformers Library
from transformers import pipeline

# Load a pre-trained model for text generation
generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2")
result = generator("Artificial Intelligence is", max_length=50)
print(result)
Conclusion
Transformers revolutionized NLP, enabling state-of-the-art performance in translation, text generation, and more.
