Blog 9: Clustering Algorithms
What is Clustering?
Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data points together based on their features. Common algorithms include:
K-Means: Partitions data into K clusters.
Hierarchical Clustering: Forms a tree-like structure of clusters.
DBSCAN: Density-based clustering for irregularly shaped clusters.
Techniques for Clustering
1.Choosing the Right Number of Clusters: Using the Elbow Method.
2.Distance Metrics: Euclidean, Manhattan, Cosine similarity.
3.Dimensionality Reduction: Applying PCA before clustering.
Simple Example: K-Means Clustering
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np

# Sample data
X = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [8, 9], [9, 10]])

# Train model
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2)
kmeans.fit(X)

print("Cluster labels:", kmeans.labels_)
Conclusion
Clustering is widely used for market segmentation, anomaly detection, and data compression. Choosing the right algorithm depends on the data structure.
