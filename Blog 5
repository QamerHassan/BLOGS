Blog 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Importance of EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps in understanding data patterns, detecting anomalies, and summarizing key statistics before applying machine learning models. Key steps include:
Summary Statistics: Mean, median, standard deviation.
Data Visualization: Histograms, scatter plots, box plots.
Correlation Analysis: Finding relationships between variables.
Techniques for EDA
1.Descriptive Statistics: Using .describe() in Pandas.
2.Data Visualization: Seaborn and Matplotlib.
3.Correlation Heatmaps: Identifying strong relationships between features.
Simple Example: Data Visualization
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample dataset
data = {"Age": [25, 30, 22, 35, 40], "Salary": [50000, 54000, 45000, 58000, 62000]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Histogram
sns.histplot(df['Age'], bins=5, kde=True)
plt.show()
Conclusion
EDA is an essential step for uncovering insights and preparing data for machine learning models. Proper analysis leads to better model performance.
