Blog 6: Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
What is Supervised Learning?
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models. Examples include:
Regression: Predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices).
Classification: Assigning labels to data (e.g., spam detection).
What is Unsupervised Learning?
Unsupervised learning finds patterns in data without labels. Examples include:
Clustering: Grouping similar data points (e.g., customer segmentation).
Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing data complexity (e.g., PCA).
Simple Example: Classification with Scikit-Learn
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load dataset
iris = load_iris()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.2)

# Train model
clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("Model Accuracy:", clf.score(X_test, y_test))
Conclusion
Supervised learning is best for labeled datasets, while unsupervised learning helps in discovering hidden patterns. Understanding both techniques is crucial for AI applications.
