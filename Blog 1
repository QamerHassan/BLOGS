Blog 1: Introduction to AI
What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines, allowing them to perform tasks like learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. AI can be broadly classified into:
Narrow AI: Designed for specific tasks (e.g., Chatbots, Recommendation Systems).
General AI: Hypothetical AI with human-like cognitive abilities.
Super AI: A theoretical AI surpassing human intelligence.
Types of AI
1.Reactive AI – No memory, only reacts (e.g., Chess-playing AI).
2.Limited Memory AI – Can use past data (e.g., Self-driving cars).
3.Theory of Mind AI – Understands human emotions (not yet developed).
4.Self-aware AI – AI with consciousness (hypothetical).
Applications of AI
Healthcare: Disease prediction, medical imaging.
Finance: Fraud detection, automated trading.
Retail: Personalized recommendations.
Autonomous Systems: Drones, self-driving cars.
Simple AI Code: Rule-Based Chatbot
def simple_chatbot(user_input):
    responses = {
        "hello": "Hi there! How can I help?",
        "bye": "Goodbye! Have a great day.",
        "what is AI?": "AI stands for Artificial Intelligence. It enables machines to think and learn."
    }
    return responses.get(user_input.lower(), "I'm not sure. Can you rephrase?")

# Example usage
user_query = input("You: ")
print("Bot:", simple_chatbot(user_query))
Conclusion
AI is transforming industries by enabling machines to mimic human intelligence. Understanding its foundations is key to diving deeper into ML and DL.
