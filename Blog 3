Blog 3: Programming for AI
Why Python for AI?
Python is the most widely used language for AI due to:
Extensive Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch.
Ease of Use: Simple syntax, great for experimentation.
Community Support: A large AI research and development community.
Essential Libraries
1.NumPy - For numerical computations.
2.Pandas - For data manipulation.
3.Matplotlib & Seaborn - For data visualization.
4.Scikit-Learn - For machine learning models.
Simple Example: NumPy Basics
import numpy as np

# Create an array
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

# Matrix operations
transpose = arr.T
sum_arr = np.sum(arr)

print("Transpose:\n", transpose)
print("Sum:", sum_arr)
Conclusion
Python provides powerful tools to implement AI efficiently. Learning its libraries is crucial for AI development.
