Blog 8: Classification Algorithms
What is Classification?
Classification is a supervised learning technique used to categorize data into predefined classes. Common algorithms include:
Logistic Regression: Binary classification (e.g., spam detection).
Decision Trees & Random Forest: Rule-based classification.
Support Vector Machines (SVMs): Separating data using hyperplanes.
Techniques for Classification
1.Feature Selection: Choosing the most relevant variables.
2.Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjusting model parameters.
3.Cross-validation: Evaluating model performance.
Simple Example: Decision Tree Classifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Train model
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
clf.fit(X, y)

print("Prediction for first sample:", clf.predict([X[0]]))
Conclusion
Classification models are fundamental in AI applications like fraud detection and medical diagnosis. Understanding different classifiers helps in building accurate models.
