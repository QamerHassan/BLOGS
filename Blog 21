Blog 21: Reinforcement Learning (RL)
What is Reinforcement Learning?
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. It is commonly used in:
Game AI (e.g., AlphaGo, OpenAI Gym)
Robotics
Autonomous Vehicles
Key Components of RL
1.Agent: Learns and makes decisions.
2.Environment: Where the agent operates.
3.Reward Signal: Guides learning by providing feedback.
4.Policy: Determines actions taken by the agent.
Simple Example: Q-Learning
import numpy as np

# Initialize Q-table
Q = np.zeros((5, 2))  # 5 states, 2 actions

# Update rule
learning_rate = 0.1
discount_factor = 0.9
reward = 10  # Sample reward
Q[0, 1] = Q[0, 1] + learning_rate * (reward + discount_factor * np.max(Q[1, :]) - Q[0, 1])
print("Updated Q-table:", Q)
Conclusion
RL is a powerful paradigm for decision-making systems. Techniques like Q-learning and deep reinforcement learning (DQN) enable complex problem-solving.
