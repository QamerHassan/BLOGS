Blog 4: Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
Importance of Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in AI that ensures the dataset is clean and structured for machine learning models. Key steps include:
Handling Missing Data: Filling or removing missing values.
Normalization & Standardization: Ensuring data consistency.
Feature Engineering: Creating new meaningful features.
Techniques for Cleaning Data
1.Handling Missing Values: Removing rows, filling with mean/median.
2.Encoding Categorical Data: One-hot encoding, label encoding.
3.Feature Scaling: StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler.
Simple Example: Handling Missing Data
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# Sample dataset
data = {"Age": [25, 30, None, 35], "Salary": [50000, 54000, 58000, None]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Handling missing values
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy="mean")
df.iloc[:, :] = imputer.fit_transform(df)

print("Cleaned Data:\n", df)
Conclusion
Good data preprocessing leads to more accurate and efficient AI models. Cleaning and transforming raw data is a key step in the pipeline.
