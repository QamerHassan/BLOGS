Importance of Feature Engineering
Feature engineering enhances machine learning models by creating meaningful features from raw data. Techniques include:
Feature Extraction: Transforming raw data into structured features.
Feature Selection: Choosing relevant features to improve model accuracy.
Feature Transformation: Normalization, encoding, and scaling.
Techniques for Feature Engineering
1.One-Hot Encoding: Handling categorical variables.
2.Binning: Converting continuous variables into categorical bins.
3.Polynomial Features: Creating interaction terms.
Simple Example: One-Hot Encoding
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

# Sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({"City": ["London", "Paris", "New York"]})
encoder = OneHotEncoder()
encoded_data = encoder.fit_transform(data[["City"]]).toarray()

print("Encoded Data:\n", encoded_data)
Conclusion
Good feature engineering can significantly improve model performance. Understanding how to create and transform features is a crucial skill for AI practitioners.
