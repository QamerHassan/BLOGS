Blog 15: Neural Networks & Deep Learning Basics
What are Neural Networks?
Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons). Key components include:
Input Layer: Receives raw data.
Hidden Layers: Extract features and patterns.
Output Layer: Produces predictions.
Common Deep Learning Architectures
1.Feedforward Networks: Standard multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs).
2.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Used for image processing.
3.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Used for sequential data like text.
Simple Example: Training a Neural Network with TensorFlow
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Create model
model = Sequential([
    Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    Dense(1, activation='linear')
])

# Compile and train
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
print("Model summary:")
model.summary()
Conclusion
Deep learning powers modern AI applications, from image recognition to language processing. Understanding neural networks is essential for advanced AI development.
