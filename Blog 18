Blog 18: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
What is NLP?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables machines to understand and generate human language. Applications include:
Chatbots & Virtual Assistants
Text Summarization
Sentiment Analysis
Common NLP Techniques
1.Tokenization: Splitting text into words/sentences.
2.Stopword Removal: Eliminating common words (e.g., "the", "is").
3.Word Embeddings: Representing words as vectors (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT).
Simple Example: Tokenization with NLTK
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
nltk.download('punkt')

text = "Natural Language Processing is exciting!"
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
print("Tokens:", tokens)
Conclusion
NLP is a crucial AI field enabling machines to interact with human language. Advanced models like BERT and GPT revolutionize NLP tasks.
