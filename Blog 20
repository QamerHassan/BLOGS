Blog 20: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
What are GANs?
GANs are deep learning models used for generating new data. They consist of:
Generator: Creates fake data.
Discriminator: Distinguishes real from fake data.
Applications of GANs
1.Image Synthesis: Creating realistic images.
2.Style Transfer: Modifying artistic styles in images.
3.Data Augmentation: Enhancing datasets for training models.
Simple Example: Building a GAN with TensorFlow
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, LeakyReLU

# Define Generator
generator = Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation=LeakyReLU(alpha=0.2), input_shape=(100,)),
    Dense(784, activation='tanh')
])

print("Generator summary:")
generator.summary()
Conclusion
GANs are widely used in AI-driven creativity. Understanding their potential and limitations is essential for generative modeling.
