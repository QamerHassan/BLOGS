Blog 7: Regression Models
What is Regression?
Regression is a statistical method used for predicting continuous values. Common types include:
Linear Regression: Simple relationships between variables.
Polynomial Regression: Fits non-linear relationships.
Ridge & Lasso Regression: Used for feature selection and regularization.
Techniques for Regression Analysis
1.Ordinary Least Squares (OLS): Minimizing error.
2.Feature Scaling: Standardizing input values.
3.Regularization: Preventing overfitting.
Simple Example: Linear Regression
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Sample data
X = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).reshape(-1, 1)
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5])

# Train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict
y_pred = model.predict(X)

# Plot results
plt.scatter(X, y, color='blue')
plt.plot(X, y_pred, color='red')
plt.show()
Conclusion
Regression is widely used for predictive modeling. Selecting the right regression technique depends on data complexity and feature interactions.
