Blog 24: AI Ethics & Bias in Machine Learning
Why is AI Ethics Important?
AI systems can exhibit bias and ethical concerns if not designed carefully. Key areas of concern include:
Bias in Training Data: Models inherit biases present in datasets.
Fairness & Accountability: Ensuring AI decisions are explainable and just.
Privacy & Security: Protecting user data.
Strategies to Reduce Bias
1.Diverse Training Data: Use balanced datasets.
2.Fair Algorithms: Implement fairness-aware learning techniques.
3.Explainability Tools: Use SHAP, LIME for model transparency.
Simple Example: Checking Bias in a Dataset
import pandas as pd

# Sample biased dataset
data = pd.DataFrame({"Gender": ["Male", "Male", "Female", "Female"], "Salary": [50, 55, 45, 48]})
print("Gender Pay Gap:")
print(data.groupby("Gender").mean())
Conclusion
AI ethics is critical for responsible AI development. Bias mitigation techniques ensure fair and transparent AI systems.
