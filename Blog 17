Blog 17: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
What are RNNs?
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of deep learning model used for sequential data. They maintain a memory of previous inputs, making them suitable for:
Time Series Forecasting
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Speech Recognition
Common RNN Architectures
1.Simple RNN: Basic recurrent connections.
2.Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Solves vanishing gradient problems.
3.Gated Recurrent Units (GRU): A simplified version of LSTMs.
Simple Example: LSTM with Keras
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Define model
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(10, 1)),
    LSTM(50),
    Dense(1)
])

# Compile model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
print("Model summary:")
model.summary()
Conclusion
RNNs are powerful for sequential data but suffer from long-term dependency issues. LSTMs and GRUs help mitigate these challenges.
